## About Me

I am currently working towards my MS in Analytics degree at the University of San Francisco. I expect to finish my coursework by the end of June 2015. In addition to completing school, I am currently seeking employment in the San Francisco Bay Area. Potential fields of interest include healthcare, public policy, education, technology, social media, and entertainment.
