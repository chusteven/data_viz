## About Me

I am currently working towards my MS in Analytics degree at the <a href = http://www.usfca.edu/>University of San Francisco</a>. I expect to finish my coursework by the end of June 2015. In addition to completing school, I am currently seeking employment in the San Francisco Bay Area. Potential fields of interest include healthcare, public policy, education, technology, social media, and entertainment.
