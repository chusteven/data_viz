        <h3>Techniques</h3>

        <p>For my parallel coordinates plot, I encoded the data by looking at average responses to each of the questions regarding depression. My hopes were to understand how age affects mental health. In general, I wanted for my age variable to be ordered, as well as each of the responses. This way, the user would be drawn to the natural progression of the responses from less depressive (older folks) to more depressive (younger folks). There is no lie-factor, the data-density is strong, but the data-ink ratio is a bit off. As far as this last point goes, I think I could have achieved the same effect in a multi-line chart, though I would've faced similar issues of ordering the varibles. This is why, ultimately, I chose to encode the data in a parallel coordinates plot.</p>

        <p>For my grouped bar chart, I encoded the data by looking at average number of days with a drink by each different grouping. My hopes were to understand, at once, trends in alcohol abuse by both race and income level. Where this visualization fails is in normalization. For example, there were many more White people sampled than there were Native Americans. In general, I was hoping to draw the user's attention to the coloring of the income brackets. I was hoping to see that richer people drink more, thus coloring their bars orange. There is no lie-factor, the data-density is strong, and the data-ink ratio is solid too. As I wanted to make multiple comparisons for simple aggregate measures, I felt as though a bar chart was both the simplest and most informative.</p>

        <p>For my small multiples plot, I encoded the data by looking at individual responses to men and women who have or have not partaken of a particular substance. I wanted to see whether men or women abuse certain substances more and if so, which group does so. I encoded the used versus not-used classes by the colors light blue and orange to suggest that people who used were a bit "bolder," so to speak. Where this visualization fails is in not showing things as relatively as possible. I tried my hardest to get each small multiple to rescale, but was not successful. There is no lie-factor, the data-density is okay (except for the last few graphs in which the scale is so far off that hardly any data is being displayed), and the data-ink ratio is solid. As I wanted to make comparisons between men and women mostly, but also for users and non-users, I knew a stacked bar chart would achieve that the best.</p>

        <h3>Interactivity</h3>

        <p>Ultimately, I was not able to implement much interactivity. If I were to, details-on-demand would perhaps be the most useful to make more accurate comparisons. As it stands, I was really only trying to see general trends in my data. To this point, having interactivity was not as necessary. I think were I to implement certain features, perhaps I would have chosen to implement focus+context to overcome issues of data-density or bad data-ink ratio.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>My classmates were greatly helpful in discussing how I could answer the questions I was trying to answer. For the most part, they told me not to worry about what I would or would not find and just to get into the data and make my visualization first before stressing about what I would find. They made strong suggestions to run simple aggregate functions to see the trends between the various groups at which I wanted to look.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>For the parallel coordinates plot, the main challenge surfaced when I first tried to do this visualization not as aggregated plot but simply with the raw data. I ended up with a lattice-like plot because all combinations of these discrete variables were met, as the data consists of over 55,000 rows. I was hoping not to have to aggregate, but this is the shortcoming of a parallel coordinates plot consisting only of discrete data, I suppose.</p>

        <p>For the grouped bar chart, the biggest challenge I faced was in not normalizing my data. If I had planned ahead better, perhaps I would have thought to bootstrap my data from the smaller groups upward, but did not. In general, however, I'm quite satisfied with this visualization as it does a decent job showing the difference between the races. Perhaps I need to spend some time focusing more on my original question of whether or not there are difference in how alcohol is abused based on income. But even then, it's possible to see some minute trends - at least within a race.</p>

        <p>The my small multiples plot, I really tried my best to rescale each small multiple's y-axis based on that particular substance's maximum value. I ran into a lot of issues with how JavaScript structures its data, however. For this reason, I was unsuccessful in my endeavors. Furthermore, it was quite a challenge to even figure out that rather than another grouped bar chart, I could simply stack my bars. Lastly, figuring out how to extend the examples I found on Michael Bostock's website to my own particular example took a lot of fooling around with the data structure. Eventually, through lots of console logs, I figured it out though.</p>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>

        <p>This was a tough project for me. I had great ideas about what I wanted to find in the dataset, but the amount of time needed to figure out how exactly I would do everything I wanted to (looking at alcohol abuse by both race and income, or looking at mental health as a general idea versus age) required me to make more compromises that I had originally planned. Though I'm satisfied with what I've produced so far, I think that given more time I would have liked to pare down the scale of each of my questions.</p>

        <p>What I did learn from my visualizations, however, are the following:</p>

        <li>Older people tend to be more mentally and emotionally stable than younger people. This is good news for a young person like myself.</li>
        <li>Asian people have a lot less alcohol than people of other races. It might be the case that richer people drink more than poorer people, but it might also be a statistical aberration based on our sampling.</li>
        <li>Men and women tend to use/not use substances equally. I had originally thought that men might abuse harsher substances in droves more than women, but as it turns out people who use substances abuse them regardless of their sex, while people who don't use substances don't use them regardless of their sex as well.</li>
